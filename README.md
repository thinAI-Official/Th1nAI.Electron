# Th1nAI.Electron
An open-source Electron port of ThinAI copilot.

# What is it? :thinking:
This version of this F0RT1ND copilot are ported into Electron. 

# How to start it?
Make sure Node.js installed, then open up your terminal on the path of Th1n.AI Electron and type npm start

# Should I decompile it?
As the open source says, you can decompile and make a open-source fork of it. But other ThinAI and Th1n.AI Python are prefered not decompiled.
